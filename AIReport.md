## Sample Prompts (Key Examples)

### 1. **Project Architecture & Component Organization**
```
"Implement a scalable component architecture for a modern SaaS landing page with the following sections: Hero (compelling headline, subtext, dual CTAs), Features (6+ AI-powered capabilities with icons), Pricing (3-tier structure with monthly/annual toggle), Testimonials (customer reviews with avatars), FAQ (collapsible accordion), and Footer (social links, company info). Organize components into logical directories with proper TypeScript exports."
```
**AI Response**: Created organized component structure with proper exports and documentation

### 2. **Brand Identity & Design System Implementation**
```
"Implement a comprehensive design system using the ADmyBRAND brand colors: Primary Blue (#415a98), Secondary Purple (#953e98), Accent Pink (#cc2487), Destructive Red (#e43c64), and Pure White (#ffffff). Create glassmorphism effects with subtle neon glows while maintaining a futuristic aesthetic. Update CSS variables and component styling to reflect the brand identity consistently across all UI elements."
```
**AI Response**: Implemented complete brand color system with glassmorphism effects and neon glows

### 3. **Hyperlocal Advertising Integration**
```
"Develop a comprehensive hyperlocal advertising showcase section that demonstrates ADmyBRAND's location-based advertising capabilities. Include transportation hubs (airports, bus stations, metro, railway), city centers (downtown, landmarks, religious centers), and mobile advertising (trucks, buses, autos, cabs, vans, trains, cars). Implement horizontal scrolling with glassmorphism cards and maintain the futuristic theme throughout the section."
```
**AI Response**: Created comprehensive hyperlocal advertising section with 15 location types and horizontal scrolling

### 4. **Third-Party Booking System Integration**

Create a configuration file to manage booking URLs and ensure all CTAs ('Book a Call', 'Get Started Free', 'Contact Sales', etc.) open the scheduling service in a new tab with proper security attributes (noopener, noreferrer)."
```
**AI Response**: Implemented Cal.com integration across all CTAs with centralized configuration

### 5. **Content Optimization & Copy Refinement**
```
"Optimize the blog section descriptions by reducing word count by 4 words while maintaining clarity, impact, and SEO value. Ensure the content remains engaging and informative for the target audience."
```
**AI Response**: Optimized content length while maintaining clarity and impact
